**Unlock the Active Speaker Thumbnail in the Zoom App**

The default Active Speaker Thumbnail in [Zoom](https://zoom.us) is always locked to one of the four corners of the screen. This is especially anoying on iPhone X-Style devices, where the Speaker window would sit above the presentation and could not be moved off to the side. The Tweak will remember the position in portrait and in landscape orientation.
